# DartCore Localization

DartCore Localization is a localization solution for Unity.

[Here](https://github.com/AtaTrkgl/DartCore-Localization/wiki) is the link to the documentation. 

## Installation

1. Open the package manager.
2. Click the plus icon on the top left.
3. Select "Add package from git URL".
4. Paste "https://github.com/AtaTrkgl/DartCore-Localization.git".

Note that Unity can sometimes fail on installing the dependencies. In that case go ahead and manually install the [DartCore Utilities](https://github.com/AtaTrkgl/DartCore-Utilities) package.
